ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Analysis: Unraveling the Flames ðŸ”¥
Dive deep into the heart of Montesinho natural park in Portugal and uncover the mysteries behind forest fires between 2000 and 2003. 

ðŸŒ² Overview
This project delves into the intricate details of forest fires, analyzing various factors that contribute to their occurrence and severity. Using a comprehensive dataset, we aim to answer burning questions about the relationship between weather conditions, geographical coordinates, and the extent of fires.

ðŸ“Š Features
* Spatial Coordinates: Understand the fire's origin from west to east and north to south.
* Time Factors: Analyze the impact of different months and days on fire occurrences.
* Fire Weather Index (FWI): Dive into the Canadian FWI system and its components to gauge fire danger.
* Moisture Codes: Explore FFMC, DMC, and DC to understand the moisture content and its implications on fires.
* Initial Spread Index (ISI): Gauge how swiftly a fire might spread.
* Environmental Factors: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and recent rainfall - how do they influence fires?

ðŸ¤” Research Questions
1. Which moisture code (FFMC, DMC, DC) is the most significant predictor for the total burned area?
2. How does the Montesinho natural park data compare with global fire data during the same period?

ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Findings
* Dive into scatter plots and regression analyses to understand the relationship between various factors and the area affected by fires.
* Compare the Montesinho natural park data with global fire data to get a broader perspective.

ðŸŒŽ Global Perspective
How does Montesinho's fire data stack up against global numbers? Discover through captivating visualizations and data comparisons.

ðŸ“œ Conclusion
Our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing forest fires in Montesinho natural park. By comparing with global data, we gain insights into the significance of these numbers on a broader scale.
